### Document Generation demos

Main site: <https://www.adobe.io/apis/documentcloud/dcsdk/doc-generation.html>

Note - these demos require your credentials in the same directory, both the JSON file and your private key.
Note - docTemplate.docx makes use of a condition loop using greater than or equal. This is currently not evaluating correctly.

* test1.js - reads in docTemplate and outputs a Word doc
* test2.js - just a slightly nicer version, outputs to Word and PDF
* helloworld.js - simple example used for a blog post
* helloword-pdf.js - a PDF version of the above
