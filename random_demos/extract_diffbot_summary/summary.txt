Adobe has a vendor security review program that evaluates vendors that collect, store, process, 
transmit, or dispose of Adobe data outside of Adobe-controlled physical offices or data center 
locations. The VSR program includes requirements for vendors to follow when handling sensitive 
data and assigns a risk level score to vendors based on their compliance with Adobe standards. 
If a vendor fails the VSR program, Adobe holds discussions with the business owner to understand 
the details of the vendor's security practices and determine whether or not to continue working with them.
